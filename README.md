## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip
- Virtual Environment (Optional)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sky-clearing
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application and input the required weather data (or fetch it directly from NOAA if integrated).
2. The system processes the data to remove noise and inconsistencies.
3. The machine learning model predicts the likelihood of clear skies based on historical weather data.
4. Results are displayed in the form of predictions and visual insights to help decision-makers at JFK Airport plan operations.

## Results
The project resulted in a predictive model with high accuracy in forecasting clear sky occurrences. The model identified key meteorological factors contributing to favorable weather conditions and delivered actionable insights for JFK Airport.

## Future Work
- **Real-time data integration**: Incorporating live weather data from NOAA to make real-time predictions.
- **Model optimization**: Enhancing the prediction model by experimenting with additional machine learning techniques and fine-tuning parameters.
- **Geographical expansion**: Expanding the project to include other major airports and creating a generalized weather prediction tool.
